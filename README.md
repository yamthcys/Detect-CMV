# Detect-CMV
Final Project of 4th year student, Khon Kaen University
This project use machine learning technology to predict the diagnostic results of Cytomegalovirus retinitis.
that we have 4 classes have
    1. CMV (class 0) A retinal fundus infected with the Cytomegalovirus
    2. normal (class 1) fundus does not found the infection of the Cytomegalovirus retinitis (No apparent retinopathy)
    3. other (class 2) fundus of the retinal infected with a condition other isn't CMVr.
    4. unknown (class 3) fundus that cannot be diagnosed or identified. 
We ran on Jupyter Notebook with Python language 
Should run in order:
    1. EDA
    2. Pre-processing 
    3. VGG (model.h5)
